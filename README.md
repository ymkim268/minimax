# minimax

## problem statement:
* minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning
* game playing similar to Candy Crush (maximize his/her share of fruits)
* beginning of game, all cells filled with fruits
* a player claims all fruit of the same type in cells either horizontally and vertically
* empty cells then are filled with fruits falling from top

## input.txt format:
* 1st line: n width, height of board
* 2nd line: p number of fruit types
* 3rd line: time-remaining in sec
* n lines: n x n board

## output.txt format:
* 1st line: selected move A-Z,0-N equivalent to col, row
* n lines: n x n board after move selected

## note:
* this does not contain the script to play against itself
* tested against other classmates, competition results posted by instructor
* out of round 9, 5th round
* need to work on better heuristics
